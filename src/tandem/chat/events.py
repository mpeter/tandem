"""What a running turn tells the window, in one vocabulary for all three
harnesses. Deliberately narrower than events.NormalizedEvent: these are
paint instructions and prompts, not transcript content — the transcript
is the harness's own file, which sync reads afterwards.

Runtime clients emit these from their worker thread; the window drains
them on the main thread. ApprovalRequest and QuestionRequest are the two
that block: the client calls Answers and waits."""
