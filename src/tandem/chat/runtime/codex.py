"""Codex app-server, one process per turn: JSON-RPC 2.0, one message per
line, over stdio (the same transport the codex Python SDK's client.py uses).

  initialize {clientInfo} -> initialized (notification)
  thread/resume {threadId, cwd[, approvalPolicy, permissions]}   or   thread/start {cwd[, …]}
  turn/start {threadId, input:[{type:"text", text}][, model]}
  … notifications (item/*, turn/*, thread/tokenUsage/updated,
    account/rateLimits/updated) and server requests (*/requestApproval,
    item/tool/requestUserInput) … until the parent turn and its workers finish.

The process holds the thread's writer lock until it exits, which is why a
new process is spawned per turn and why a lock error is reported, never
retried. Requests are built from the generated models; notifications and
server requests are validated by them (unknown fields ignored); the two
thread responses are read as dicts because their models carry dozens of
unrelated fields that drift between releases."""
