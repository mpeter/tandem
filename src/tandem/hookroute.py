"""PreToolUse routing: should this native Agent dispatch run on codex?

Pure decision logic — the CLI wrapper owns process concerns (stdin, exit
codes, the once-per-session stamp file). Returning None means 'emit
nothing': the dispatch proceeds natively. That is the failure mode for
everything unexpected. The second decision here — missed_reroute_notice —
is what keeps two of those silences explainable instead of merely quiet."""

    agent instructions, so a body captured here would not match what that
