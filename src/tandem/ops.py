"""Session operations shared by the CLI: catch-up drain, cursor
fast-forward, switch, and one-off routing.

Echo suppression: every entry tandem appends to a shadow is, by
construction, already represented in the other file. So whenever a harness
changes role (switch, or a one-off turn routed to it), we first drain the
outgoing source's unsynced tail, then fast-forward the incoming source's
cursor to end-of-file — from that point only genuinely new turns flow, and
nothing synced ever bounces back.
