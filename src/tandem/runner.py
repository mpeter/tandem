    before the Stop hook / notify touches the sentinel, so idle means the
    sentinel is at least as new as the transcript. Returns False if
    `cancelled()` turned true first.

    Two modes, because transcript quiescence means different things:

    - `marker_wired=True` (the harness was launched with the turn-complete
      hook — the common case): an actual marker at least as new as the
      transcript is required. Tool calls and approval waits can stay silent
      indefinitely, so quiescence never releases a marker-wired wait.
    - `marker_wired=False` (no hook — e.g. codex with a user-configured
      notify handler tandem refuses to clobber): 2s of transcript quiescence
      is the fallback boundary, because nothing better exists.

    `quiesce` controls only the marker-less fallback and defaults to 2s.
    A failed completion hook leaves the flip armed until it is cancelled
    or the user exits the harness manually.

    The transcript is re-read every poll through `provider`, because the path
    is not always known when the wait starts: codex mints its own session id
    and the runner's tail thread discovers the rollout seconds later. The
    default provider returns the `transcript` argument forever, which is the
    standalone (already-known path) contract this function shipped with.

    An unknown transcript is *not* evidence of idleness. `_mtime(None)` is
    0.0, so the plain `s >= t` test would call every unknown-transcript
    session idle and fire a flip in the middle of a turn. With the marker
    wired, hold until discovery provides the transcript and a completion
    marker closes its turn. A missing marker is not completion either, even
    when the transcript path is known but no file has appeared yet.

    File mtimes and the marker-less quiescence comparison use wall-clock
    time so their readings are comparable.

    With `status_probe` (claude sessions), the probe is the entire
    boundary test and the marker/quiescence rules above never run: the
    probe reads claude's own session registry, which distinguishes a
    running turn ("busy") from an idle prompt ("waiting") directly.
    Anything but "busy" — including no answer at all — flips
    immediately: single-tier by spec, eager on registry schema drift.
    The transcript-noise problem this solves: modern claude appends
    housekeeping (away_summary, last-prompt) minutes after Stop and
    bumps the transcript mtime on resume, so sentinel >= transcript is
    false while the session sits idle at its prompt."""

class FlipMonitor:
    """Owns the flip lifecycle: the armed flag (toggle to cancel), the
    turn-boundary wait, and the termination ladder through the PtyControl.
    One background thread; all public methods are thread-safe.

    `transcript` is a live attribute, not a constructor snapshot: codex mints
    its own session id, so the runner's tail thread discovers the rollout
    after launch and publishes it here. The wait loop re-reads it every poll
    through a provider closure — a plain attribute read/write, which the GIL
    makes atomic, so no lock is needed (and none may be added: `armed()` runs
    inside the SIGWINCH handler on the pump thread).

    `marker_wired` says whether this launch actually got a turn-complete
    hook, which decides how the wait reads transcript quiescence (see
    `wait_until_safe`). The caller derives it from the adapter: the argv the
    runner already appended, `adapter.hook_argv_extra(sentinel)`, is empty
    exactly when no hook was wired (codex declining to clobber a
    user-configured notify), so `marker_wired=bool(hook_extra)` — reusing the
    list that went into argv rather than calling the adapter a second time,
    since a second call re-reads config and could disagree with what was
    actually launched.

    `status_probe` (claude only) reads the harness's own session
    registry and, when present, replaces the transcript/sentinel rules
    entirely — see `wait_until_safe`.

    `on_flip_decided` fires once, on this thread, in the gap between the
    decision and the ladder — the runner starts the incoming harness's launch
    worker there, so its boot overlaps the outgoing one's teardown. It is
    called with the flag already set (`flip_requested` is what makes the flip
    inevitable, and a callback must not be able to take it back) and its
    exceptions are swallowed: a failed hook costs a cold flip, never the flip
